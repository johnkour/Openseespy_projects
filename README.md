# Openseespy_projects
Some simple examples with Openseespy.
The file **Basic_Truss.py** is our first example and performs a simple linear elastic analysis in a 3 element 2D truss.
The file **Section_Analysis.py** is our second example, it defines the section and initializes the model for a simple cantilever.
In the file ***Documentation.xlsx*** we define the geometry of the model and the section for the second example a bit more graphically.
